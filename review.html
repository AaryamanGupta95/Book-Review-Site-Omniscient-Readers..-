                                                1984 is a book that I found to be both incredibly disturbing and
                                                incredibly
                                                powerful. George Orwell's writing is so vivid and evocative, and he does
                                                an
                                                incredible job of creating a world that feels both familiar and
                                                terrifyingly
                                                alien. The book tells the story of a man named Winston Smith who lives
                                                in a
                                                dystopian society where the government has total control over every
                                                aspect
                                                of citizens' lives. What I appreciated most about the novel was the way
                                                it
                                                explored issues like censorship, propaganda, and the dangers of
                                                unchecked
                                                power. The characters are all so well-drawn and complex, and I found
                                                myself
                                                deeply invested in Winston's journey even as I felt increasingly
                                                disturbed
                                                by the world around him. Ultimately, "1984" is a book that I would
                                                highly
                                                recommend to anyone who loves stories that challenge them to think
                                                deeply
                                                about the world around them. It's a book that will stay with you long
                                                after
                                                you've finished reading.

                                                There has never been any other movie or movie series that has sent me on
                                                such an emotional roller coaster. The series truly fills in empty spots
                                                in your life and maybe even replaces ones. this could be either and good
                                                or bad thing, personally it was the most emotional part for me making it
                                                a little bit of both. when i was done with the series i truly felt sad
                                                and depressed that there were no more movies to watch. In order to boost
                                                my mood I had and still do watch the series over and over as many times
                                                as possible, to remind me of all the characters and hogwarts, my

                                                Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is one of the most informative and
                                                interesting books I have ever read. This book has changed the way I see
                                                things and has inspired many other people I know, by its incredibly well
                                                writing story and facts. This book should be a model for all other books
                                                talking about anthropology because even if we won't admit it, we are
                                                greedy and selfish and destroyed almost all the fauna in the world, but
                                                we are capable of great things too. We can create myths and stories that
                                                will last dozens of millennia. We can unite and live together at an
                                                amazing speed and coordinate as the world has never seen before. This is
                                                the story of our kind and its beginnings are by far as or more important
                                                than the present and the future. I congratulate Yuval Noah Harari for
                                                this breathtaking masterpiece and recommend this book to every single
                                                person out there to read it at least twice.

                                                This book is a Duology, and is hence divided into two parts (first part
                                                is complete, second part is ongoing) Both the parts have been published
                                                inside this same book instead of creating two separate books for part
                                                one and part two, that's why there is a high number of chapters. If you
                                                like part one, please continue to read part two which starts right after
                                                the sequel to part one. I hope to make a trilogy out of this book
                                                someday

                                                So far I am half way through the book, I didn‚Äôt have the best start in
                                                life and I wanted to change that outcome for my children and I. I was
                                                never educated with money or taught how to be smart with it as my mom
                                                wasn‚Äôt great with it either, I am smart with my education but not money.
                                                I always wanted to be different financially but didn‚Äôt know where to
                                                start and this book has given me the key. I‚Äôm so glad I found this book
                                                at 28 instead of 58. I cannot stress enough the importance of getting
                                                your children and future generations to read this book as braking that
                                                cycle now will pay off later for them. We as parents always want our
                                                children to do well and not face the problems we do, start with this
                                                book and educate them before they leave home. It will be one of the best
                                                things you can do.

                                                "David Copperfield" is a story of a posthumous child who has lost his
                                                father before birth and at the age of 12 he lost his mother.Hense a
                                                sensitivity of lack of confidence ,naive innocence and anxiety felt to
                                                him.Afterwards he leave that place and started struggling to shape his
                                                own life. He struggled to forg an identity as a man and learn how to
                                                survive in a world governed by musculine values.His first statement was
                                                "whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that
                                                station will be held by anybody else."He becomes a novelist after
                                                following a career in journalism for a number of years.For me really it
                                                was an impressive, advanturous , struggling and inspiring novel which
                                                gives us lesson that how to keep survive in these modern times.Life
                                                means struggle to live. it is the most interesting book i have ever
                                                read.

                                                I loved that this book was partly based on the visions of Hildegard de
                                                Bingen. Also, in many ways it reminded me of my time at Ursuline College
                                                which was an extremely and wonderfully woman-centered college. (It was
                                                exactly what I needed. I was so obsessed with boyfriends that I might
                                                not have made it through school at all in an all-gender environment. I
                                                was able to FOCUS!)
                                                The Ursuline nuns were founded centuries ago by Angela Merici whose
                                                mission was the education of girls. I thank God/Goddess for the strong
                                                women of the past, like the main character of Matrix, that have led to

                                                Undoubtedly,
                                                The best book i have ever read !! Pride and prejudice is a book that is
                                                must read for every person.starting of the some pages it must be hard to
                                                understand bcoz of different character but the beauty of the different
                                                characters, language nd play of words is a tremendous,that the reader is
                                                compelled, stick nd just go on reading.
                                                The novel makes us aware of the people like Wickham & also of the
                                                consequences of being haughty as Darcy. The novel revolves around the
                                                importance of marrying for love, not simply for economic gain or social
                                                prestige, despite the communal pressure to make a good.
                                                Darcy also wins the reader's heart gradually.He too became my favourite
                                                character gradually.This story made me credulous about hatred
                                                transforming into deep love.l recommend everyone to read this awesome
                                                work by the prolific author.

                                                Queen: As It Began: The Authorized Biography by Jim Jenkins is supposed
                                                to be the only 'authorized' book about the earliest origins, and
                                                chronology of their beginnings and development. I haven't read it yet,
                                                it's on the way, but it's supposed to be written in conjunction with,
                                                and with the approval of, the band members.

                                                None of the other books that are out there were written with the
                                                personal involvement of the band members, this one supposedly is. I
                                                can't say with certainty if that's a fact, but I've read some stuff
                                                about Jim Jenkins, who was one of their earliest, and most devoted fans,
                                                who actually got to be friends with the band, and it seems legit.

                                                Just finished reading The Picture of Dorian Gray and I have to say that
                                                it is now my favourite book ever!! This was a novel that I only knew by
                                                name and I always wanted to give it a read to see what it was all about.
                                                I read a preview of the first chapter through Kindle and was immediately
                                                hooked, so much so that I went to the library the next day to borrow it.
                                                Oscar Wilde‚Äôs writing is beautiful, thought-provoking, and also easy to
                                                understand. The way he describes the scenery paints a vivid image in
                                                your mind. I could picture exactly what Basil Hallward‚Äôs garden looks
                                                like, and the many rooms in Dorian Gray‚Äôs house. I am a big fan of
                                                gothic literature so I enjoyed this book very much. I recommend reading
                                                this book while drinking a cup of tea and listening to classical music.
                                                It immerses you into the story and makes for a great reading experience.

                                                This book is a timeless epic that masterfully portrays life and
                                                investigates its elements with an intimate session understanding. I was
                                                particularly moved when Patrick Star challenged Ringo Star to the duel
                                                in Book 2, and When Squidward sold himself into prostitution to provide
                                                for his young son Benjamin Button‚Äôs curious illness. When Pennywise
                                                jumped off the Krusty Krab and RKO‚Äôd John Cena himself , only to realise
                                                he had seemingly jumped on thin air, I was breath taken. Tolstoy
                                                understanding of relation and connection was excellently demonstrated in
                                                Spider-Man and MJ‚Äôs marriage in Book 7. To anyone thinking of reading
                                                this novel, do not hesitate, it is the greatest work of literature since
                                                Borat (or the unexpected virtue of sexy time). Do read.

                                                I have read a myriad of books and lot of a different genres but this is
                                                by far the best book I have ever read. Although this book starts off
                                                slow and can be difficult to get into at first, if you keep at it you
                                                will discover a very complex and dark storyline that will continue to
                                                astonish you at the end of every chapter. Emily Bront√´ has created some
                                                of the most deep and intricate characters that I have ever read, making
                                                it hard to pick who‚Äôs truly good or bad in her story; Heathcliff has
                                                definitely made a lasting impression on my mind as one of the greatest
                                                and misunderstood villains in any storyline ever told. If you are
                                                looking for an intriguing read that will surely become one of your all
                                                time favorites then Wuthering Heights is the book for you!
